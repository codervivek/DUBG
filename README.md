# DUBG (DisasterUnknown's Battlegrounds)

Our idea is to build a **crowd-sourced post-disaster** management application which will mainly used for **rescue of victims**. We separated our target audience into **three categories - volunteers, rescue teams members** and **victims**. All users have coordinates associated with them. **Volunteers** will be included in rescue teams **based** on **their location** and **choice of task**. **Rescue teams** will be **assigned objectives** to be completed strategically whereas victims will be **directed to the nearest camp in shortest time possible**.
 
One of our main and unique idea is to make a **navigation system in augmented reality** which would currently be **accessible** via a **smartphone**. This technology can be extended to **Microsoft Mixed Reality devices** but as we don’t have access to one, we’ll make our app for android phones. Apart from this, as our app is crowd-sourced, allowing users to be updated based on **data acquired by other users**. This can be used to quickly **mark new obstacles, closed roads etc** for **easy routing** and **coordination** of rescue teams and victims.  For **example**, a new place is reported as being affected by **flood**. As soon as that place is marked by any user, it would **reflected** in our **app** and all users would be able to **see** the **affected place** and **number of victims** would be shown on the app. A **preview** of app screen is shown (instead of given places, rescue spots, victims etc would be marked with different colors). One can **click** that place to get **AR based navigation** to that place.

This AR can be placed in the **Rescue Team’s helmet** or as additional **Mixed Reality headsets** for important person in a volunteer team.

We plan to make our app **mostly offline** and use data whenever possible to update the current status of markers. There will also be **Web Dashboard** where all current activities and markers will be displayed. The app will also take the **status of the current situation**, such as quantities of commodities and number of victims and rescue team members, as inputs and **suggest the best strategy** to be followed by users for **maximizing the chances of a successful drive.**
