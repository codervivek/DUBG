# DUBG (DisasterUnknown's Battlegrounds)

## Motivation:
DUBG is a crowd-sourced mixed reality app for efficient post disaster management. Rescuer teams are very busy during operation, which is why we make our app based on Mixed Reality so that the rescuers donâ€™t waste time on operating the app. This app is supposed to be used with Microsoft Mixed Reality for hasslefree experience of the rescue teams and getting live updates of the rescue drive but due to lack of resources and time we have implemented it as an android app. We have divided the functionality of our app based on 2 main categories of our users:- Helpers and Victims.


## Features:

* AR Navigation functionality which allows rescuers to view the route to the affected area through  Augmented Reality. This allows the users to navigate easily even at night or in sandy duststorm when their vision is obstructed due to particles or improper lighting conditions. This prevents the delay in action of rescue teams in critical situations. 

* For effective communication we have added a feature of AR Notification. This feature makes it possible for messages to be projected in AR on the location of the sender. It allows receivers to view important messages, like informing other rescue teams about road blockage or current status of victims, to be hovering in AR space.  This makes messages to be viewed as per the convenience of receiver just like in some situation people prefer messages over calls because of the choice to view and respond as per their convenience. AR notification prevents unnecessary distraction of rescue teams with information not required by the team at that moment.    

* The AR functionality can also be used to see the live updates of other rescue teams and status of victims.

* For victims stuck at the disaster location, they can use this app to notify the authorities about their situation using the SOS functionality of app. This allows quick update on the number of victims stuck and injured there. 

* The helpers can report the status of Victims through the DUBG website after logging through their credentials.

* The website has a dashboard which show the location of affected areas on map to give a sense of the magnitude of the disaster.
